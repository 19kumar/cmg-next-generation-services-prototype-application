                <p>We will ask you questions about yourself, your children and how you want child
                  maintenance to be paid.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Helpful information about the other parent</h2>

                <p>We need information about the other parent so we can set up your child maintenance application.
                  You will need to give their name and as much other information as you can.
                  This could include:</p>

                          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>their phone number</li>
                            <li>any details about where they live or work</li>
                            <li>their date of birth or age</li>
                            <li>their National Insurance number</li>

                <div class="govuk-inset-text">If you do not know all of these details you can still apply but it might take longer to set up your application.</div>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Setting up an online account</h2>

                <p>As part of your application, we will set up an online child maintenance account for you.
                  We will ask you to create a personal identification number (PIN), a password and give
                  your email address.</p>

                <div class="govuk-inset-text">Only you and our team will be able to see the security details you create.</div>
