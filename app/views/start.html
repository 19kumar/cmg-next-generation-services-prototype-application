                lead-in, people often do not recognise the signs of domestic abuse - try 'these bahaviours'. Still a save and return expectation.</td></tr>

                  Contact question: 'Are you comfortable...?' â€“ 'brilliant question, feels like i'm not going to be pushed into anything'.
                  Payment types - reassurance over contact.
                  Support links - 'really good that you're putting them there, amazing'</br></br>
                  Agents â€“Â good support for domestic abuse questions - more types of abuse discussed (financial); shared care - difficult, filter questions, random nights, 'nightmare';
                  spelling of children's names; next steps â€“ 'up to 6 weeks'; 'maintenance liabiility order' - learned we need to forget this, focus on payments; 'known-as' name; other parent info - follow-up probing questions.</p>
